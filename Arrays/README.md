1. Compose a program that creates a one-dimensional array a containing exactly 1000 integers and then attempt to access a[1000]. what happens when you run the program?  
a. 1000  
b. value of the array at the start  
c. value of the array at the end  
d. indexing error  

2. what is wrong with the following code fragment?  
    a = []
    for i in range(10):
        a[i] = i * i

3. what does the following code fragment write?  
    a = stdarray.createID(10, 0)
    for i in range(10):
        a[i] = 9 - i
    for i in range(10):
        a[i] = a[a[i]]
    for v in a
        stdio.writeln(v)

4. what is a[] after executing the following code fragment?
    n = 10
    a = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        a += [a[i-1] + a[i-2]]

Bonus: Compose a program that takes an integer command-line argument n and n poker hands (five cards each) from a sheffled deck, seperated by blank lines
